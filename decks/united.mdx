Today we'll be talking about [Sister Bingham's talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/34bingham?lang=eng) from the April 2020 General Conference, United in Accomplishing God's Work. She opens her talk discussing Adam and Eve and how beautiful life was in the Garden of Eden. Everything was new to them and learning to interact with their surroundings, in addition to figuring out how to best obey the commandments given to them by Heavenly Father, "caused some initial anxiety and confusion".

After the Fall, they learned how to work together and "became united in accomplishing the purposes God had for them -- and for all of His children."

  "Because they understood that their earthly purpose and eternal goal were
  identical, they found satisfaction and success in learning to labor in love
  and righteousness together"
</h2>

<Content>

Now as mortals, Adam and Eve had to labor for food and survival. They probably had several occasions where they had different opinions on how to approach a problem or challenge. But they had learned how essential it is so act in _unity_ and _love_. As their family grew, Adam and Eve taught their children what heavenly messengers had taught them: what to do to be happy in this life and how to prepare to "return to their heavenly parents after having increased their abilities and proved their obedience to God".

In [Moses 5:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng) in the Pearl of Great Price, it reads:

> "And it came to pass that after I, the Lord God, had driven them out, that Adam began to till the earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as I the Lord had commanded him. _And Eve, also, his wife, did labor with him._" (emphasis added)

Adam and Eve worked _together_ to live, raise their family, and teach their posterity the gospel.

  "As centuries and then millenia came and went, the clarity of men's and
  women's inspired and interdependent contributions became clouded with
  misinformation and misunderstandings...Lucifer knows that if he can damage the
  unity men and women feel, if he can confuse us about our divine worth and
  covenant responsibilities, he will succeed in destroying families, which are
  essential units of eternity"
</h2>

<Content>

I LOVE this point that Sister Bingham makes in this section of her talk. So much of what society has taught is about our "gender roles" are cultural and societal constructs. She states that "Lucifer knows that if he can damage the unity men and women feel, if he can confuse us about our divine worth and covenant responsibilities, he will succeed in destroying families, which are essential units of eternity"

As members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and especially as women, how do we discern what our contributions within our marriage, Church callings and functions, and all of our interactions in life are supposed to be? Sister Bingham continues:

> "Satan incites comparison as a tool to create feelings of being superior or inferior...His goal has been to foster a power struggle...so over the years and around the globe, a full understanding of the divinely interdependent and yet differing contributions and responsibilities of women and men largely disappeared. Females in many societies became subservient to males rather than side-by-side partners, their activities limited to a narrow scope. Spiritual progress slowed to a trickled during those dark times; indeed, _little spiritual light could penetrate minds and hearts steeped in traditions of dominance._" (emphasis added)

With a gospel perspective and understanding that we are here on Earth to learn, to progress, to be happy, and ultimately return to live with Heavenly Father again, how should men and women be working with each other?

  What does unity look like for you and your family?
</h2>

<Content>

How does a gospel perspective impact your relationships with men and women? More specifically, how does a knowledge of the gospel impact your relationship with your spouse?

Your relationship and family dynamic should involve Heavenly Father. Just as we are all unique individuals, Heavenly Father has a unique plan that is the best fit for you and your family.

_As a preface to my story, the experiences I share are my own and may be different from others'_

For example, growing up in the Church, my Young Women's leaders always taught that we were to become the best person we could be and progress and develop all of these different facets of who we are as individuals. But then when we got married, our responsibility was to be a homemaker and mother and nothing else. That never sat quite right with me. How could I be taught so emphatically that it was important to develop who I was as an individual and then all of a sudden leave that behind for the next several decades to raise a family? Why did one have to seemingly exclude the other?

Fast forward to the present where I have been married for almost 4 years. I graduated from college, became a mother, and have a loving husband who has a great job. This kind of life is what I had been taught for years that I should strive for! And yet I wasn't happy...about 8 months post partum, I finally figured out what my problem was: I had spent my entire life learning, studying, exercising, growing and pushing myself in all aspects of my life and suddenly all of that had come to a screeching halt.

Of course being a mother has brough me the greatest joy I've ever experienced! But a part of me still felt unfulfilled. I didn't like doing "the mom thing", so to speak, all day. Every day. And not much else. Even though mom's do A LOT, and I was mentally and emotionally exhausted most days, I still felt like I wasn't contributing equally in our family. So my husband and I talked about it! For a long time. Several times.

How could we find a better balance, greater unity, in our family? What could we do to make sure we both felt like we were contributing and progressing equally? After a lot of research, fasting, and prayer, we decided that I should enroll in Lambda School, an online sort of coding bootcamp. I started their part-time program that is held in the evenings from 7pm-10pm, 5 days a week, for 18 months. It's been a sacrifice not having that time to spend together, but 8 months into the program, I can say wholeheartedly that I feel so much happier. I LOVE learning again. I love taking what I've learned and creating something out of it! It has brought a different kind of satisfication and fulfillment into my life that I wasn't getting before.

Now, none of this is to say that this is the kind of lifestyle that we should all have. My point is that unity might look different for everyone _and that's okay._ Are you a working mom? Great! Stay-at-home mom? Awesome! Student or working wife? You go, girl! What's important is that your family decisions are made between you, your spouse, and Heavenly Father. We're here to learn and progress and what better way to do that than in perfect love, unity, and support of each other?

  "How does understanding priesthood authority and power change our lives?"
</h2>

<Content>

After a brief overview of the restoration of the gospel through Joseph Smith, Sister Bingham reminds us of the organization of the Relief Society via revelation and priesthood power and authority. She reiterates recent teachings that "women who are set apart under the direction of one holding priesthood keys operate with _priesthood authority_ in their callings."

In October 2019, President Russell M. Nelson taught that "women who are endowed in the temple have _priesthood power_ in their lives and in their homes as they keep those sacred covenants they made with God."

> "The heavens are just as open to _women_ who are endowed with God's power flowing from their priesthood covenants as they are to men who bear the priesthood."

Sister Bingham then poses this question: **how does understanding priesthood authority and power change our lives?**

She proposes that one of the keys is understanding that when men and women work together, "we accomplish a great deal more than we do working separately."

  "Unity is essential to the divine work we are privileged and called to do"
</h2>

<Content>

Sister Bingham then recounts her conversation with President Nelson about the impact of women on the restoration of the gospel from Lucy Mack Smith and Emma Smith alone, without getting into the counteless other examples of strong, influential women.

> "We are most effective when we are willing to learn from one another and are united in our goal to become disciples of Jesus Christ and help others along that path."

She reminds us that the "priesthood blesses the lives of God's children in innumerable ways", from Church callings to relationships to our day-to-day lives. Sister Bingham reiterates that:

> "This interdependence of men and women in accomplishing God's work through His power is central to the gospel of Jesus Christ restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith."

  "Being more in tune with the divine pattern of working together in unity is
  critical"
</h2>

<Content>

Sister Bingham reminds us that while women "do possess distinctive, divine gifts and are given unique responsibilities...those are not more -- or less -- important than men's gifts and responsibilities." And vice versa.

> "_All_ are designed and needed to bring about Heavenly Father's divine plan to give each of His children the best opportunity to fulfill his or her divine potential."

She continues, saying that men need to become "true partners" instead of assuming they are either solely responsible for everything or "act as 'pretend' partners while women carry out much of the work". At the same time, Sister Bingham declares that women need to step forward "and take their rightful and needful place as partners rather than thinking they need to do it all by themselves or wait to be told what to do".

  Will we strive to overcome cultural bias and instead embrace divine patterns
  and practices based on foundational doctrine?
</h2>

<Content>

Sister Bingham states that "seeing women as vital participants is not about creating parity but about _understanding doctrinal truth_." (emphasis added) Rather than call for an establishment of a program, she encourages us to _actively work_ to value women as God does: "as essential partners in the work of salvation and exaltation."

She promises that as we strive to overcome cultural bias and embrace divine patterns and practices based on foundational doctrine, "we will learn to value each individual's contributions and increase the effectiveness with which we fulfill our divine roles" and that "we will feel greater joy than we have ever experienced."
