## Physical Health vs Spiritual Health

Today's lesson is a big analogy of being healthy physically vs. being healthy spiritualy. The key is _balance_ in all things. Physically, we're just going to focus on physical activity and exercise (although nutrition is equally important!).

It's important to remember that everything is individual. What might be "healthy" for one person might not work for someone else. We throw around the word "health" a lot in our society, with this connotation that certain foods or activities are "best" or the "right" way to live. But what's healthy for one person might not be healthy for someone else.

What is healty for you depends on what stage of life you're at right now. Everyone's body, everyone's lifestyle is different. So your personal approach to physical activity should be individualized and adapt to the changes in your life. Whether that be day to day, semester to semester, year to year, your physical health plan should adapt

Everyone's plane **SHOULD** be different. Maybe you're training for a marathon or your first 5k. Maybe you're trying to lost weight or you want to set a good example for your kids or have more energy. Maybe you're trying to get stronger or get outside more to enjoy the beauty of the world around you. Whatever your reasons are, you have some sort of a plan! There are lots of different things you can do to reach that goal, no matter how tangible it is. There's running, biking, strength training, going for walks, rock climbing, yoga, Zumba, meditating...there are so many different things we can do! And you can do them every day, twice a week, for 15 minutes or for 2 hours.

But as we all know, sometimes our schedules and family situation don't always allow us to follow the plan we want. Maybe we don't have the means to go to the gym or the time to exercise for very long or even the physical capability to right now. But there are still smaller, less time consuming things we can do every day that can still contribute to our physical health. The small things are just as important as the bigger ones, especially if we do them consistently!

Your spiritual health plan should be the same! It needs to be individual and adaptable with the changes in your life. Maybe there are stages in your life where you can read your scriptures for an hour every day or go to the temple every week or do lots of service. But sometimes life gets crazy. Between school, work, and our families, sometimes we can't follow our ideal plan. That's why it's important to adapt! What matters is that we start where we are.

Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf once said to "lift where you stand". Even though he was talking about the growth of the Church, I think it can be easily applied to our own personal growth and progress, both physically and spiritually. God doesn't care where we've been. He cares that we're trying out best every day and heading in the right direction. And your best changes every day! Maybe today I can do 25 pushups and tomorrow I can only do 10. Maybe today I can read my scriptures for 30 minutes and tomorrow I can do 5. Maybe last year I could run 3 miles and this year I can walk for 15 minutes. Maybe last year I could go to the temple every week and this year I can go once every other month.

What matters is that we have a plan of different "exercises" we can consistently do given the stage of life that we're currently in.

Let's step back for a minute and examine the word "exercise". If we look at the etymology of "exercise", we can see what some of its original meaning(s) was. One that stands out in particular to me is "remove restraint". When we physically exercise, we become stronger and thus remove the "restraint" that is the inability to lift or move something heavier.

  “It is more likely that [Heavenly Father] will give us opportunities to
  develop those [spiritual] gifts rather than just granting them to us without
  spiritual and physical effort.”

Heavenly Father expects us to work to grow spiritually stronger, just like we have to work to make our physical muscles stronger.

  “If we seek more patience, we may find ourselves needing to practice it while
  waiting for a response. If we want to have more love for our neighbor, we can
  foster it by sitting next to a new face at church. With faith it is similar:
  when doubts come to our minds, trusting in the Lord’s promises will be
  required to move forward. In this way, we are exercising spiritual muscles and
  developing them into sources of strength in our lives. It will probably not be
  easy at the beginning, and it might even become a big challenge.”

"The words of the Lord, through the prophet Moroni, apply to us today: ‘And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have [or exercise] faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.’”

In a [BYU devotional](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/edward-eyestone/following-worthy-mentors/), Coach Ed Eyestone, head coach of the BYU men's cross country and track &amp; field teams, shared an experience he had with one of his athletes.

> “At the end of cross-country season that fall, Kyle came into my office with a proposal. ‘Coach,’ he said, ‘I feel like in track I have kind of plateaued. I’m stuck at 4:05, and I’m not getting any faster.’"

For a bit of context, running a sub-4 minute mile is _extremely_ difficult, so this athlete was already incredibly fast to run a time of 4:05.

> "'Well,' I asked, 'what are we going to do about it?'"

> "He said, 'I don’t think there is one single thing I can do to cut off five seconds, but I do think there are ten things I can do that can each cut off half a second and together will total five seconds and get me under four minutes.'"

This athlete had a clear goal: break 4 minutes in the mile. So he made a specific, action-based plan together with his coach. After carefully following his plan, the athlete did, in fact, meet his goal of breaking 4 minutes in the mile.

What lessons can we learn when it comes to meeting our spiritual goals?

Consistency is key! Start where you are and act with purpose and intent. Include Heavenly Father in the creation of your plans to meet your goals, and include Him in your efforts as you work to put your plan into action.
