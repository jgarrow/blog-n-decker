<Intro>

In the April 2020 General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, [Elder Jeffrey R. Holland of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles spoke](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/43holland?lang=eng) about the need to hope when facing 'insurmountable odds'.

<Content>

Today we'll be talking about [Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's talk](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2020/04/43holland?lang=eng) from the April 2020 General Conference, A Perfect Brightness of Hope. He opens his talk discussing how he and his wife took up President Nelson's invitation to look back to "see the majesty of God's hand in restoring the gospel of Jesus Christ". Elder Holland shares the hopes that he and Sister Holland thought they would've had two centuries ago about a God and religion.

For the sake of brevity for this lesson, we won't cover this part of his talk too much and instead will focus more on the second half of his talk.

  What does having hope look like for you?
</h2>

<Content>

With a gospel perspective about the Plan of Salvation and the Atonement of Jesus Christ, what does it mean to you to have hope? What does that look like for you?

In [2 Nephi 31:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#p20), it says:

> "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men..."

It is not enough to simply trust that all will turn out ok and then sit back and do nothing. We must press forward! We must continue to work, obey the commandments, and strive to make the world a better place, trusting that God will make the difference.

  "And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound
  in good works."
</h2>

<Content>

Alma teaches us that if we have faith, hope, and charity, the _result_ is that we will "always abound in good works" ([Alma 7:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.24?lang=eng#p24)). Faith, hope, and charity are not passive attributes of disciples of Christ. We must actively build up the kingdom of God by helping to make the world around us a better place.

  "We still have hopes that have <em>not</em> yet been fulfilled. Even as we
  speak, we are waging an 'all hands on deck' war with COVID-19, a solemn
  reminder that a virus 1,000 times smaller than a grain of sand can bring
  entire populations and global economies to their knees. We pray for those who
  have lost loved ones in this modern plague, as well as for those who are
  currently infected or at risk.We certainly pray for those who are giving such
  magnificent health care."

What powerful words at such a chaotic time. This year alone, the world has been combatting COVID-19, leaving us with added stress and anxiety as we face the unknown and uncertanties of the future, both immediate and more long term. Even more recently, racist and prejudiced events have arisen again, stirring up pains and frustrations from discriminated communities. With all of the chaos and turmoil in the world, how can we hope for a better future?

  "Because the Restoration reaffirmed the foundational truth that God does work
  in this world, we <em>can</em> hope, we <em>should</em> hope, even when facing
  the most insurmountable odds."
</h2>

<Content>

Elder Holland continues:

> "That is what the scripture meant when Abraham was able to [hope against hope](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/4.18?lang=eng#p18#18)—that is, he was able to believe in spite of every reason _not_ to believe—that he and Sarah could conceive a child when that seemed utterly impossible. So, I ask, 'If so many of our 1820 hopes could begin to be fulfilled with a flash of divine light to a mere boy kneeling in a patch of trees in upstate New York, why should we not hope that righteous desires and Christlike yearnings can still be marvelously, miraculously answered by the God of all hope?'”

  "Lasciate ogni speranza, o voi che entrate"
</h2>

<Content>

In Dante Alighieri's famous _Divina Commedia_, there is an inscription over the gates of Inferno (hell):

> "Lasciate ogni speranza, o voi che entrate." / "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

Elder Holland explains that when we truly lose all hope, "our last sustaining possession", "what we have left is the flame of the inferno raging on every side."

  “[We] did not come this far only to come this far.”
</h2>

<Content>

In light of recent events with George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests, I think it would be wrong not to address it. Looking back over the course of our country's history, it's incredible to see the progress and advancements we have made. However, it pains my soul to see the prejudice, discrimination, and disrespect for human life that is still pervasive in our society. I echo these words Elder Holland quoted from a sister missionary during a multi-stake conference in Johannesburg:

> “[We] did not come this far only to come this far.”

The fight for equality and human rights has not stopped. We must do our part to help make our hopes, and the hopes of others, a reality. Yesterday, our prophet, President Russell M. Nelson [posted the following](https://www.facebook.com/russell.m.nelson/posts/3015443371856412) on his social media accounts:

> "We join with many throughout this nation and around the world who are deeply saddened at recent evidences of racism and a blatant disregard for human life. We abhor the reality that some would deny others respect and the most basic of freedoms because of the color of his or her skin.
>
> We are also saddened when these assaults on human dignity lead to escalating violence and unrest.
>
> The Creator of us all calls on each of us to abandon attitudes of prejudice against any group of God’s children. Any of us who has prejudice toward another race needs to repent!
>
> During the Savior’s earthly mission, He constantly ministered to those who were excluded, marginalized, judged, overlooked, abused, and discounted. As His followers, can we do anything less? The answer is no! We believe in freedom, kindness, and fairness for all of God’s children!
>
> Let us be clear. We are brothers and sisters, each of us the child of a loving Father in Heaven. His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, invites all to come unto Him—“black and white, bond and free, male and female,” (2 Nephi 26:33). It behooves each of us to do whatever we can in our spheres of influence to preserve the dignity and respect every son and daughter of God deserves.
>
> Any nation can only be as great as its people. That requires citizens to cultivate a moral compass that helps them distinguish between right and wrong.
>
> Illegal acts such as looting, defacing, or destroying public or private property cannot be tolerated. Never has one wrong been corrected by a second wrong. Evil has never been resolved by more evil.
>
> We need to foster our faith in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.
>
> We need to foster a fundamental respect for the human dignity of every human soul, regardless of their color, creed, or cause.
>
> And we need to work tirelessly to build bridges of understanding rather than creating walls of segregation.
>
> I plead with us to work together for peace, for mutual respect, and for an outpouring of love for all of God’s children."

We cannot turn a blind eye. We must be _active_ in our hope, fully trusting that Heavenly Father will help us change and repent and make the world a better place.

  "I have 'promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go
  before I sleep.'"
</h2>

<Content>

In conclusion, Elder Holland references Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening":

> "The gifts and blessings that flow from that gospel mean everything to me—everything—so in an effort to thank my Father in Heaven for them, I have 'promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.' May we press forward with love in our hearts, walking in the 'brightness of hope' that lights the path of holy anticipation we have been on now for 200 years. I testify that the future is going to be as miracle-filled and bountifully blessed as the past has been. We have every reason to hope for blessings even greater than those we have already received because this is the work of Almighty God, this is the Church of continuing revelation, this is the gospel of Christ’s unlimited grace and benevolence. I bear witness to all of these truths and so much more in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."

As one of the few POC in our ward, I feel an obligation to invite you all to deeply reflect on how your race impacts your life. How does what you look like affect what you do or don't do? What you worry or don't worry about?

It is not enough to say "I'm not a racist." A sincere, deep self-introspection can help you better understand minorities and have greater compassion. Greater compassion can provide greater motivation in our efforts as we hope for a better future. Let us heed [Nephi's counsel](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31.20?lang=eng#p20):

> "Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life."
